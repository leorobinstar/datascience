week 1: 
(1) Choosing a dataset :
    After reviwing the provided data sets, i chose MARS CRATERS for my analysis as i am intrested in mars the red rusty planet.  

(2) Research question and Hypothesis:
    My research question is the relation between the Diameter circle and Depth Rim floor.
    
    Hypothesis:
    : Depending or by studying the diameter and the depth rim floor, we can tell the actual size of Astroid before it hit the surface.
    : Sizes of astroids, how much impact they react depending on individual size.
    : Is there any possiblity to destroy the astroid before it hit the surface, by studying its sizes and strength.

(3) The literature review include clear information about search terms used AND 
    The literature review clearly identify references used.

(4) The literature review clearly present a summary of findings (e.g., variables considered, patterns of findings, etc). 
    Variables consideres:
    : CRATER_ID :- crater	ID	for	internal	sue,	based	upon	the	region	of	the	planet	
                   (1/16ths),	the	“pass”	under	which	the	crate	was	identified,	ad	the	order	in	which	
                   it	was	identified.
                   
    : DEPTH_RIMFLOOR_TOPOG :- average	elevation	of	each	of	the	manually	
                              determined	N	points	along	(or	inside)	the	crater	rim(units	are	km).
                              
    : DIAM_CIRCLE_IMAGE :- diameter	from	a	non-linear	least	squares	circle	fit	to	the	
                           vertices	selected	to	manually	identify	the	crater	rim	(units	are	km).
                           
    :	MORPHOLOGY_EJECTA :- ejecta	morphology	classified.	Examples	below.
                           If	there	are	multiple	values,	separated	by	a	“/”,	then	the	order	is	the	
                           inner-most	ejecta	through	the	outer-most,	or	the top-most	through	
                            the	bottom-most.
